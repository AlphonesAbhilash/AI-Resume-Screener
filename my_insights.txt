Firstly I used chatgpt as my mentor..

I've faced many problems and Complications while integrating AI...
I thought to use Chat Gpt but some billing and api issues have come..
For simpler and easy usage I gone to Gemini api..
Again face lot many problems with model..

Later me and chatgpt have fixed by analyzing and testing them..

We came to know that Gemini-pro which we are trying to use is not available now..
So we figured it out and used gemini-1.5-pro model..

Again we tested and it finally worked..

Thanks to Chatgpt for being as my mentor..

Next Tasks: 1. Combining Score and AI response or 2. Turning into a web application..
